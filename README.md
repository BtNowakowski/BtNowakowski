# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Bartosz, a passionate software tester and developer.


ðŸŒŸ I love working on projects that challenge me and push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's front-end development with React or backend systems with Python, I'm always eager to learn and grow.

ðŸš€ When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, watching some good movies or sipping on coffee.
